# WP Base
My subjective basic Composer-WordPress blueprint

## How to use 

* remove all plugins you do not wish to install
* if you want to use **ACF Pro** you need to add a license key
* some plugins like **WP Mail SMTP** tend to remove their old tags from the repository, either change their version number to `"*"` or keep them in sync with wpackagist
